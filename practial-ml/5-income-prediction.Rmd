<h1> Methodology: CRISP-DM Cross Industry Standard Process for Data mining</h1>

![Crisp DM ](/home/datahawk/code/dswithr/rprogramming/practial-ml/crisp-dm.png)

<h2> Business Understanding </h2>
Marketing department at a financial planning company would like to identify prospective customers from a database that it purchases.
The target customer is anyone with an annual income over $50,000, but we do not get income information about our new customers.
Therefore, we'd like to develop a model that analyzes other factors to help us predict whether a potential custom has an income over the $50,000
threshold.
We'll use logistic regression for this task


<h2> Data Understanding </h2>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
income <- read_csv("income.csv", col_types = "nffnfffffnff")
glimpse(income)
```

<h3> Data Exploration </h3>

``` {r}
income %>%
  keep(is.factor) %>%
  summary()
```
Value Distribution of variable: workClassification

``` {r}

income %>%
  select(workClassification) %>%
  table()

```

Value Distribution of variable: educationLevel

```{r}

income %>%
  select(educationLevel) %>%
  table()

```

Value Distribution of variable: occupation

``` {r}
income %>%
  select(occupation) %>%
  table()

```

Value Distribution of variable: nativeCountry

``` {r}
income %>%
  select(nativeCountry) %>%
  table()

```

<h2> Data Preparation </h2>

Replace unknown values for workClassification, occupation, and nativeCountry with code (UNK)

``` {r}

income <- income %>%
  mutate(workClassification = dplyr::recode(workClassification, "?" = "UNK")) %>%
  mutate(nativeCountry = dplyr::recode(nativeCountry, "?" = "UNK")) %>%
  mutate(occupation = dplyr::recode(occupation, "?" = "UNK"))

income %>%
  select(workClassification,nativeCountry,occupation) %>%
  summary()
```

Transform income variable to binary

``` {r}
income <- income %>%
  mutate(income = dplyr::recode(income, "<=50K" = "0")) %>%
  mutate(income = dplyr::recode(income, ">50K" = "1"))

income %>%
  select(income) %>%
  summary()

```

Splitting Testing and Training Data Set


``` {r}

set.seed(1234)
sample_set <- sample(nrow(income), round(nrow(income) * .75), replace = FALSE)

income_train <- income[sample_set, ]
income_test <-income[-sample_set,]

nrow(income_train)
nrow(income_test)

income_train %>%
  nrow()
```

Check Class Distribution

``` {r}

colnames(income)

income %>%
  select(income) %>%
  table() %>%
  prop.table() * 100


income_train %>%
  select(income) %>%
  table() %>%
  prop.table() * 100


income_test %>%
  select(income) %>%
  table() %>%
  prop.table() * 100
```
Balance the training data set with SMOTE()

``` {r}
library(DMwR)
set.seed(1234)
income_train <- SMOTE(income ~ ., data.frame(income_train), perc.over = 100, perc.under = 200 )

income_train %>%
  select(income) %>%
  table() %>%
  prop.table() * 100
```

<h2> Modeling </h2>

Training The Model

``` {r}
income_mod1 <- income_train %>%
  keep(is.factor) %>%
  glm(formula = income ~ . , family = binomial)

summary(income_mod1)

```

<h2> Evaluation </h2>

Generating predictions against data - probabilities from 0 - 1

``` {r}
income_pred1 <- predict(income_mod1, income_test, type = 'response')

head(income_pred1)
```

Determine the ideal cutt-off point with function: ideal_cuttoff

``` {r}
library(InformationValue)

ideal_cutoff <- 
  optimalCutoff(
    actuals = income_test$income,
    predictedScores = income_pred1,
    optimiseFor = "Both"
  )

ideal_cutoff

```

Recode predictions using the ideal cutt-off

``` {r}
income_pred1 <- ifelse(income_pred1 >= ideal_cutoff, 1, 0)

head(income_pred1)

```

Evaluate model against test data

``` {r}
income_pred1.table <- table(income_test$income, income_pred1)

sum(diag(income_pred1.table)) / nrow(income_test)

```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
