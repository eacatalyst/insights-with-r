<h2> Data Understanding </h2>

```{r}
library(arules)

groceries <- read.transactions("Student/Data/groceries.csv", sep = ",")
```


<h3> Exploring the Data </h3>

```{r}
summary(groceries)
```

10 most frequenty bought items at the store

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
groceries_frequency <- 
  tibble(
    Items = names(itemFrequency(groceries)),
    Frequency = itemFrequency(groceries)
  )
```


```{r}
groceries_frequency %>%
  arrange(desc(Frequency)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

```

Summary statistics of item frequencies

```{r}

groceries_frequency %>%
  select(Frequency) %>%
  summary()

```
Generating Rules

```{r}

groceryrules <- 
  apriori(groceries,
          parameter = list (
            support = 0.015,
            confidence = 0.25,
            minlen = 2
          ))

```
Evaluatiing The Rules

```{r}
summary(groceryrules)
```

Top 10 rules in terms of confidence

```{r}
groceryrules %>%
  sort(by = "confidence") %>%
  head(n = 10) %>%
  inspect()

```

Different Perspective

```{r}

groceryrules %>%
  sort(by = "lift") %>%
  head(n = 10) %>%
  inspect()
```

```{r}
groceryrules %>%
  subset(!items %in% c("whole milk", "other vegetables")) %>%
  sort(by = "lift") %>%
  inspect()

```
